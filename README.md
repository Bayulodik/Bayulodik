- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bayu lodik

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game development

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning making games
  with several game engines that I have tried,
  currently the game engines that I often try
  are Godot and Unity, and I also recently tried
  making a visual novel game with Ren'py.
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like sweet food,
  my favorite is indie games,
  I rarely use social media except Facebook
